# Mining-Insider-Trading-Data
In this project, the insider trading data of a company with the highest number of insider trasactions during the period of April 2020 to March 2023 was mined from a financial website called Finnhub.io which is a real-time RESTful API offering its users access to many different forms of stock trading data. After examining the insider transactions of different popular public comapnies like Google, Facebook, Twiter, Goldman Sachs, Tesla, Gamestock and so on from the Finnhub.io's database, it was determined that Tesla had the highest number of insider trasanctions and so the insider trading data of Tesla of the time period of April 2020 to March 2023 was mined.

The insider transactions API (Application Programming Interface) request of Finnhub.io was used in this project. A single request allows mining the trading data of a time period of 12 consecutive months and so three requests were written to mine the trading data of the previous 36 consecutive months in the Python file, Mining Insider Trading Data.py. The string data was converted into a data frame, which is a dataset organized into a two dimensional table of rows and columns, to better perform the data manipulation. From the variables in the mined dataset, two more attributes were derived in this project which are Dollar Volume and Type. 

After running the Mining Insider Trading Data.py, the dataset in the CSV file TSLA.csv was obtained.
